We set the camera to be focused on the glass sphere, so naturally that will be focused in the image itself. The farther you get away from the sphere, the more blurry the objects will appear to be. The sphere is the sharpest, and the cube below it is pretty sharp, but in the distance you can notice that the other sphere and rectangular prism are much less focused and are more blurry. Controlling the aperture (or f-stop) of the camera affects the amount of light coming in as well as the depth of field of the image and the blurriness of the background. Since we exaggerated the f-stop to a really low number, the depth of field was much more shallow and the background was a lot more blurry as a result.
