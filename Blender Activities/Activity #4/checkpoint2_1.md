The cube is blurred since the cube is in motion and is between the start and end positions. Where the two positions of the cube overlap is where there's a more solid region, such as the region directly below the glass sphere. And the regions where the cube positions wouldn't overlap is where there's a translucent blur show us that the cube was in motion between those positions and was there at some point. Eveything else that wasn't in motion has zero blur, and this makes perfect sense. Since the rest of the object don't move, they remain in the same positions, so there's no possible way they can blur unless the camera itself moved, but the camera is also stationary along with the rest of the objects, so they remain perfectly sharp and without blur. We can affect the amount of motion blur there is in a video by altering the shutter speed of the camera. Lower shutter speeds will reduce blur, while increasing the shutter speed will increase the amount of blur.
