The displacement map alters the geometry of the object by displacing the points on the surface in accordance with the values on the displacement map. As can be seen, the actual geometry of the table was altered, as the surfaces of the object were displaced using the displacement map. Since the displacement map wasn't exactly built for use with the table, it also leads to some funky results, which can be seen in the checkpoint2_3_0.png image.
