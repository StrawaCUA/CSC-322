At the pixel value of (960, 540), the first image (with a light intensity of 1000W) has an RGBA value of (0.26678, 0.26678, 0.26678, 1.0000), while the second image (with a light intensity of 250W) has an RGBA value of (0.06669, 0.06669, 0.06669, 1.0000). The 1000W light is 4 times more powerful than the 250W light. Also, the pixel values in the first image are also in turn almost exactly 4 times those of the second image. As such, there appears to be a direct, positive linear relationship between power and irradiance.
