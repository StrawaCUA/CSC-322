Smooth shading basically does what the name implies: it makes the surface appear smooth. Both types of shading preserve the actual shape of the object. Though, flat shading will shade each invidual polygon on the surface with a set color value for the entire polygon, while smooth shading will shade the entire object gradually so that there's a smooth and unnoticeable transition between the polygons on the surface of the object. It also in turn makes the object appear more realistic, which oftentimes is what's desirable. There is a weird visual bug with the smooth shading image that I wasn't able to get rid of though. It's noticeable considering the shading is a little quirky in an obvious spot.
