At the pixel value of (960, 540), the first image has an RGBA value of (0.26678, 0.26678, 0.26678, 1.0000), while the second image (where the light is roughly half the distance away) has an RGBA value of (0.71858, 0.71858, 0.71858, 1.0000). The RGB values at that pixel of the second image are about 2.69353025 times that of the first image, but the second image has a light source that's roughtly half the distance of that in the first, so the relationship can't be a direct one. As such, it has to be some form of an inverse relationship. The relationship between the distance of the light and the irradiance is in reality an inverse square law, where the irradiance is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance that the light is from the object.
