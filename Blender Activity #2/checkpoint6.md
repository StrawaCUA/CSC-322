Changing the focal length affects both the angle of view and the magnification of the object. Making the focal length longer in turn makes the angle of view narrower and magnification higher, while making the focal length shorter results in making the angles of view wider and magnifications lower. As such, if we raise the focal length and then back up so that the subject is the same size as prior, we'll be able to see more of the object than if we had a shorter focal length and were closer to the subject.
