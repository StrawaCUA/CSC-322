Now using a subdivision, the sphere appears less a lot less like a 3D shape consisting of a lot of polygons and instead more like an actual smooth sphere. With the flat shading, you can still see each individual division (or shape) on the surface is shaded with a single color across its entirety, but the shape itself appears to be smooth. Meanwhile, with smooth shading, it accomplishes the same goal as previously where the entire object is shaded gradually such that there's a seamless transition between the divisions. Because the shape itself and the shading both appear to be smoothened out, this smooth-shaded, subdivided sphere actually looks like a real sphere. In short, in this case the subdivisions make the object itself appear more smoothened out while the smooth shading makes the shading of the object appear smooth and gradual. Subdivisions in truth allow us to define the surface of the object. With that, we can use subdivisions to define the true shape of the surface of the object and use smooth shading to give it the realistic shading, thus allowing for a higher quality render. But we can also use one in place of the other if we don't need such precise detail and still get a decent render quality, especially if the scene is complex.
